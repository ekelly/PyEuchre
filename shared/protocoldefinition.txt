There will be a game lobby, where you type in the name of the game
you want to join. If a game does not yet exist at that name, a new one
is created.

All games start by having 4 computer players. You can join a game at your
desired seat by indicating which player number you would like to be. If you
are unlucky, this seat might be taken just as you are sending your request to
be that player. If that's the case, you'll get an error message and be forced
to select another seat.

To join a game, send this JSON:

{
    "request": "join",
    "player": [0-3]
}

You will get back one of these messages, depending on whether or not the join
was successful. If response is less than 0, an error occurred and the optional
error key will specify what type of error occurred. The payload field should
exist in every response from the server.

{
    "response": -1,
    "error": "JoinError",
    "payload": "This player has already been claimed."
}

{
    "response": 0
    "payload": GameState
}

You can request to change your name with the following request. Name requests
are not required to be unique. A successful name change will trigger a
GameState update, as in the payload above.

{
    "request": "namechange",
    "player": [0-3],
    "name": "<name request>"
}

Every time the state of the game changes, you'll get a message above containing
the GameState, so the client can update their internal reference. NOTE: The
GameState is specific on a player by player basis. Each GameState is NOT
identical.

A GameState changes depending on what the state of the game is at that point in
time. For instance, the GameState before the game starts is different from
the GameState while the game is in progress.

The GameState before the game starts looks like this:

{
    "playerNum": 0,
    "players": ["<user-supplied name>", "Computer Player 1",
                "<user-supplied name>", "Computer Player 3"],
    "readyStatus": [true, true, false, true]
}

As soon as everybody indicates that they are ready to start, the game will
begin. Players can indicate readiness with the following message.

{
    "request": "ready"
    "ready": true/false
}

And after it starts:

{
    "playerNum": 0,
    "players": ["<user-supplied name>", "Computer Player 1",
                "<user-supplied name>", "Computer Player 3"],
    "score": [0, 0] // First 0 is even team, second 0 is odd team
    "round": {
        "dealer": 0, // Who is the dealer for this round
        "roundState": "bid"/"bid2"/"play"/"end" // bid2 is if maybe_trump rejected
        "maybeTrump": "JS", // What trump card are we bidding on?
        "trump": null/"H", // null if trump not yet set, "<Suit>" if set
        "calledTrump": 0, // The player who called trump
        "goingAlone": false/true, // Is the player who called trump going alone?
        "turn": 0, // Who's turn is it?
        "playerCards": [["JS", "9C", "9D", "AH"], 4, 3, 4],
        "tricks": [{
                "initialCard": "QH",
                "cards": ["QH", "JD", "JH", "9H"],
                "winner": 2
            }, {
                "initialCard": "AS",
                "cards": [null, null, "AS", null],
                "winner": 2 // While in progress, winner is the current winner
            }, None, None, None]
        }
    }
}

To decide trump:

{
    "request": "trump",
    "trump": "H"/"D"/"S"/"C"/null
}

To play a card:

{
    "request": "playCard",
    "player": [0-3]
    "card": "JS"
}
